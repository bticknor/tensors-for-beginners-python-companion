# Tensors for Beginners Python Companion

## Introduction

Youtube user eigenchris has provided an amazing introductory video series on tensors, which can be found here:

This repository contains Python code that replicates some of the algebra in the series' videos, and provides some numeric examples of tensors in action.  The only dependencies are SymPy - used for symbolic computing - and NumPy - used for tensor/array operations.  I found it helpful to have an interactive workspace while working my way through the videos, and I hope that the material here helps reinforce the concepts in the videos and provides useful strategies for implementing them in Python.

## Depenedencies

- jupyter
- sympy
- numpy

## Usage

- Clone the repository
- from a terminal, run `jupyter notebook`
- navigate to the `Tensors for Beginners - Python Companion.ipynb` notebook and click on it in the Jupyter UI
- execute the block of code with the imports
- navigate to the header of the specific video you are interested in and play around!
